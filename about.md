Hello.

My name is Thiago Bertolino, and I'm a Brazilian developer. I started developing systems since my graduation at the University, and currently I work as a Full Stack Developer in a startup.

I currently dedicate my career to the study of new technologies like Swift, and Javascript.

Here on this blog I'm going to write some things about systems development, technologies, habits and anything else I'm into.

You can find me on the links below.
